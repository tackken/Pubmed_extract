https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698222/,"We performed a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression to determine if dietary protein supplementation augments resistance exercise training (RET)-induced gains in muscle mass and strength. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL and SportDiscus. Only randomised controlled trials with RET ≥6 weeks in duration and dietary protein supplementation. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions with four a priori determined covariates. Two-phase break point analysis was used to determine the relationship between total protein intake and changes in fat-free mass (FFM). Data from 49 studies with 1863 participants showed that dietary protein supplementation significantly (all p2 (51, 570)) and mid-femur CSA (7.2 mm2 (0.20, 14.30)) during periods of prolonged RET. The impact of protein supplementation on gains in FFM was reduced with increasing age (-0.01 kg (-0.02,-0.00), p=0.002) and was more effective in resistance-trained individuals (0.75 kg (0.09, 1.40), p=0.03). Protein supplementation beyond total protein intakes of 1.62 g/kg/day resulted in no further RET-induced gains in FFM. Dietary protein supplementation significantly enhanced changes in muscle strength and size during prolonged RET in healthy adults. Increasing age reduces and training experience increases the efficacy of protein supplementation during RET. With protein supplementation, protein intakes at amounts greater than ~1.6 g/kg/day do not further contribute RET-induced gains in FFM.",Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Review; Systematic Review,"A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults.",2018,British journal of sports medicine
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25057266/,"The effects of protein supplementation on muscle thickness, strength and fatigue seem largely dependent on its composition. The current study compared the effects of soluble milk protein, micellar casein, and a placebo on strength and fatigue during and after a resistance training program. Sixty-eight physically active men participated in this randomized controlled trial and underwent 10 weeks of lower-body resistance training. Participants were randomly assigned to the Placebo (PLA), Soluble Milk Protein (SMP, with fast digestion rate) or Micellar Casein (MC, with slow digestion rate) group. During the 10-week training period, participants were instructed to take 30 g of the placebo or protein twice a day, or three times on training days. Tests were performed on quadriceps muscles at inclusion (PRE), after 4 weeks (MID) and after 10 weeks (POST) of training. They included muscle endurance (maximum number of repetitions during leg extensions using 70% of the individual maximal load), fatigue (decrease in muscle power after the endurance test), strength, power and muscle thickness. Muscle fatigue was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the SMP group at MID and POST (-326.8 ± 114.1 W and -296.6 ± 130.1 W, respectively) as compared with PLA (-439.2 ± 153.9 W and -479.2 ± 138.1 W, respectively) and MC (-415.1 ± 165.1 W and -413.7 ± 139.4 W, respectively). Increases in maximal muscle power, strength, endurance and thickness were not statistically different between groups. The present study demonstrated that protein composition has a large influence on muscular performance after prolonged resistance training. More specifically, as compared with placebo or micellar casein, soluble milk protein (fast digestible) appeared to significantly reduce muscle fatigue induced by intense resistance exercise.",Journal Article,"Effects of soluble milk protein or casein supplementation on muscle fatigue following resistance training program: a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study.",2014,Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20126965/,"Creatine and protein supplementation can enhance the training outcomes of young subjects, but it is not clear if there are benefits for older individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of creatine and protein supplementation on strength gains following a traditional resistance training program for middle-aged and older men. This study assessed changes in strength of men aged 48-72 years following 14 weeks of resistance training supplemented with creatine and/or protein. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design placed 42 males into one of four groups: Resistance Trained Placebo (RTP, n=10); Resistance Trained Creatine (RTCr, 5g Cr, n=10); Resistance Trained Protein (RTPr, 35g whey Pr, n=11); or Resistance Trained Creatine and Protein (RTCrPr, 5g Cr and 35g Pr, n=11). All groups trained 3 days per week for 14 weeks. The resistance training program was based on progressive overload. Training loads corresponded to 80% 1 RM (one repetition maximum strength), 3 sets of 8 repetitions for the following exercises: knee extension/knee flexion; bicep curl/tricep extension; military press; lat pull down; seated leg press; and bench press. 1 RM for each exercise and measures of lean body mass were assessed prior to and following the 14 week program. Each group significantly (p < 0.05) increased strength and lean body mass, however, there were no significant group effects or group X trial interactions. Resistance training in middle-aged and older men significantly increased muscular strength and added muscle mass with no additional benefits from creatine and/or protein supplementation.","Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",The effects of supplementation with creatine and protein on muscle strength following a traditional resistance training program in middle-aged and older men.,2010,"The journal of nutrition, health & aging"
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16948480/,"The purpose was to compare changes in lean tissue mass, strength, and myofibrillar protein catabolism resulting from combining whey protein or soy protein with resistance training. Twenty-seven untrained healthy subjects (18 female, 9 male) age 18 to 35 y were randomly assigned (double blind) to supplement with whey protein (W; 1.2 g/kg body mass whey protein + 0.3 g/kg body mass sucrose power, N = 9: 6 female, 3 male), soy protein (S; 1.2 g/kg body mass soy protein + 0.3 g/kg body mass sucrose powder, N= 9: 6 female, 3 male) or placebo (P; 1.2 g/kg body mass maltodextrine + 0.3 g/kg body mass sucrose powder, N = 9: 6 female, 3 male) for 6 wk. Before and after training, measurements were taken for lean tissue mass (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), strength (1-RM for bench press and hack squat), and an indicator of myofibrillar protein catabolism (urinary 3-methylhistidine). Results showed that protein supplementation during resistance training, independent of source, increased lean tissue mass and strength over isocaloric placebo and resistance training (P < 0.05). We conclude that young adults who supplement with protein during a structured resistance training program experience minimal beneficial effects in lean tissue mass and strength.","Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Effect of whey and soy protein supplementation combined with resistance training in young adults.,2006,International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16767436/,"We determined the effects of protein supplementation immediately before (PRO-B) and after (PRO-A) resistance training (RT; 12 weeks) in older men (59-76 years), and whether this reduces deficits in muscle mass and strength compared to younger men (18-40 years). Older men were randomized to PRO-B (0.3 g/kg protein before RT + placebo after RT, n=9), PRO-A (placebo before + protein after RT, n=10), or PLA (placebo before and after RT, n=10). Lean tissue mass, muscle thickness of the elbow, knee, and ankle flexors and extensors, and leg and bench press strength were measured before and after RT and compared to databases of younger subjects (n=22-60). Myofibrillar protein degradation (3-methylhistidine) and bone resorption (cross-linked N-telopeptides) were also measured before and after RT. Lean tissue mass, muscle thickness (except ankle dorsi flexors), and strength increased with training (P<0.05), with little difference between groups. There were no changes in 3-methylhistidine or cross-linked N-telopeptides. Before RT, all measures were lower in the older compared to younger groups (P<0.05), except for elbow extensor muscle thickness. Following training, muscle thickness of the elbow flexors and ankle dorsi flexors and leg press strength were no longer different than the young, and elbow extensor muscle thickness was greater in the old men (P<0.05). Supplementation with protein before or after training has no effect on muscle mass and strength in older men. RT was sufficient to overcome deficits in muscle size of the elbow flexors and ankle dorsi flexors and leg press strength in older compared to younger men.","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Protein supplementation before and after resistance training in older men.,2006,European journal of applied physiology
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16686554/,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of resistance training in combination with a leucine and whey protein supplement or a carbohydrate placebo on strength and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA). Thirty-three men (mean age +/- SD = 22.4 +/- 2.4 years) were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) supplementation group (SUPP), (2) placebo group (PL), or (3) control group (CON). The SUPP and PL performed unilateral training of the leg extensor muscles with the nondominant limb for 8 weeks. The strength of each limb, muscle CSA of the quadriceps femoris (QF), and body composition were assessed pretraining and posttraining. The results indicated significant increases in strength for both limbs in the SUPP but only the trained limb in the PL. The increase in strength for the trained limb of the SUPP was greater than that for the trained limb of the PL. There was no significant increase in strength for either limb in the CON. There were significant increases in the CSA of all muscles of the QF of the trained limb for the SUPP and PL, and of the vastus lateralis of the untrained limb for the SUPP. The increases in QF CSA did not differ between the SUPP and PL. No significant CSA changes were found for either limb in the CON. There were no significant changes in body composition for the SUPP, PL, or CON. The current findings suggest that leucine and whey protein supplementation may provide an ergogenic effect which enhances the acquisition of strength beyond that achieved with resistance training and a carbohydrate placebo.","Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Effects of leucine and whey protein supplementation during eight weeks of unilateral resistance training.,2006,Journal of strength and conditioning research
